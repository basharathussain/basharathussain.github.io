## Course Description  
This basic course explores the concepts, techniques, and applications of Machine Learning (ML), providing students with the theoretical foundations and hands-on skills required to design, train, and evaluate predictive models. The course covers both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, introduces neural networks and deep learning, and emphasizes model evaluation, optimization, and practical deployment considerations. Students will work with Python-based ML tools and libraries such as Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas to solve real-world problems.  

### Key Topics Covered

  - History and evolution of ML.
  - Overview of ML categories: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

- **Python for Machine Learning**
  - Data manipulation with Pandas and NumPy.
  - Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- **Regression Models**
  - Simple and multiple linear regression.
  - Model evaluation metrics for regression tasks.

- **Data Preprocessing and Pipelines**
  - Feature scaling, encoding, and transformation.
  - Building automated ML pipelines.

- **Classification Models**
  - Logistic regression, k-NN, Na√Øve Bayes.
  - Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
  - Perceptron and multilayer perceptron architectures.
  - Backpropagation and activation functions.

- **Optimization and Regularization**
  - Gradient descent variants (SGD, Adam, RMSProp).
  - L1/L2 regularization, dropout.

- **Advanced Models**
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM) and kernel tricks.
  - Decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting.

- **Unsupervised Learning**
  - Clustering (K-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN).
  - Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).
