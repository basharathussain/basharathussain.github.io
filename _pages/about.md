### ***Brief Introduction*** 

# Basharat Hussain

**GenAI** || **LLM** || **Multimodality** || **RAG** || **Fine-Tuning** || **N8N** || **VectorDB** || **Software Technical Lead** || **Solution Architect** || **Deep Learning** || **Machine Learning** || **Cloud Computing** || **PhD** || **Assistant Professor @ FAST**

Basharat Hussain received his **Ph.D. in Computer Science** from *COMSATS University Islamabad*, Pakistan, and holds an **M.S. in Computer Science** from the *International Islamic University (IIUI)*, Islamabad. With over **23 years of professional experience**, he has developed and architected enterprise-grade software solutions for multinational companies in **Europe** and the **USA**, specializing in **software design, architecture, and development** using **C++**, **C#**, **ASP.NET Core**, **Java**, **HTML**, and **Python**.

Currently, he serves as an **Assistant Professor** in the Faculty of Computing at **FAST National University**, Islamabad, where he leads research in **deep learning**, **large language models (LLMs)**, **motion diffusion**, **multimodal AI**, and **federated learning**. His research further explores **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **LoRA-based model fine-tuning**, and the integration of **Vector Databases** for advanced AI pipelines.

Beyond academia, Basharat provides **technical consultancy** on real-world and cutting-edge **LLM-driven solutions**, leveraging tools such as **N8N** for workflow automation, **VectorDB** for semantic search, and **cloud-native architectures** for scalable AI deployments. His work bridges **applied research** and **practical engineering**, delivering AI-powered solutions in **intelligent transportation**, **generative AI**, and **autonomous systems**.

His research interests are in “intelligent transportation systems and large language models” and include data modeling, simulation, stability, and control in the domains of smart travel and generative models. In addition, he performs research on the application of software technologies, cloud computing, IoT, federated learning and machine learning for design and operation research systems.

Here's the latest Nov. 2024 cloud computing seminar short at a university campus in Islamabad.
